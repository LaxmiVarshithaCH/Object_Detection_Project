# 🧠 Object Detection Project

This project focuses on building a custom object detection model using the YOLOv5 architecture. The model is trained to detect specific objects from images and videos and can be used for various applications like real-time detection, automation, and surveillance.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Dataset preparation for object detection
- Model training using YOLOv5
- Result analysis through loss/mAP curves
- Detection on new unseen images

The notebook `object_detector.ipynb` contains the entire training pipeline.

## ✅ Features

- 📦 Custom object detection
- 📈 Real-time training visualization
- 🖼️ Supports inference on new images
- 🔧 Easy to extend and fine-tune
- 📁 Exports results in image and CSV format

## ⚙️ Installation

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaxmiVarshithaCH/Object_Detection_Project.git
cd Object_Detection_Project


### Install YOLOv5 dependencies

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and PyTorch installed.


🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook or use VS Code to run object_detector.ipynb.

2. Train the Model
Follow the training section inside the notebook:

Define your dataset path and number of classes

Start training using YOLOv5

3. Run Inference
After training:

Upload a new image

Run the detection cell

Get bounding boxes and class labels

📂 Dataset Structure
Your custom dataset should be organized like this:
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
├── labels/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/

Label files should be in YOLO format:
<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>

🏋️‍♂️ Training Details
Model: YOLOv5s

Epochs: 100 (or as configured)

Batch size: 16

Image size: 640x640

Optimizer: SGD or Adam

Loss Function: YOLO Loss (Bounding box loss + Objectness + Classification)

📊 Results
Training metrics are saved in:

runs/train/exp/results.png — visual graph (loss, precision, recall, mAP)

runs/train/exp/results.csv — epoch-wise logs

Example:
| Metric    | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| mAP\@0.5  | 0.89  |
| Precision | 0.92  |
| Recall    | 0.87  |

🖼️ Example Outputs:
| Input Image                | Output with Detections       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![input](sample_input.jpg) | ![output](sample_output.jpg) |
